                Building CubeSats is no easy feat, so the Husky
                Satellite Lab is always looking to expand our team.
            </p>
            <p>
                We seek freshman, sophomores, juniors, seniors, and
                graduate students of all backgrounds and levels of experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                We look for people who are dedicated, willing to learn,
                and passionate about space and space technology.
            </p>

                Although we're currently accepting applications,
                it may take us a few weeks to reply
                since we're nearing the end of the academic year.
                This also means we won't be able to provide new
                members with full onboarding support at this time.

            <h3>Troubleshooting Info</h3>
            <p>The application form is only available when signed in to a UW Google account. If you
                still
                have a
                problem, try these steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sign in to your UW Google account in an incognito tab, and open this application from there. This
                    should
                    ensure
                    that no other Google accounts are signed in.</li>
                <li>If that doesn't work, sign in with your UW NetID to the <a
                        href="https://uwnetid.washington.edu/manage/?google" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Manage UW
                        Google Page</a>, and ensure that your <em>Account Status</em>
                    is <em>Active</em>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Sponsors</h2>
            <a class="anchor" id="sponsor"></a>
            <p>The Husky Satellite Lab would not be able to do the work it does without our sponsors. The Husky
                Satellite Lab has received hardware, software, and financial sponsorships from companies in the
                aerospace and engineering industries.</p>
            <p>We are 100% student run, and in an effort to stay as independent as possible, we are always looking for
                funding from outside sources.</p>
