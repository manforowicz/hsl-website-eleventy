            <h2>Sponsors</h2>
            <a class="anchor" id="sponsor"></a>
            <p>The Husky Satellite Lab would not be able to do the work it does without our sponsors. The Husky Satellite Lab has received hardware, software, and financial sponsorships from companies in the aerospace and engineering industries.</p>
            <p>We are 100% student run, and in an effort to stay as independent as possible, we are always looking for funding from outside sources.</p>
